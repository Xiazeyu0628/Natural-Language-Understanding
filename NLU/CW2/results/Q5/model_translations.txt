finally , we must remember the lives of the local accounts .
mr von , if i feel you , you understand you the vote to vote .
what does the question ?
it is vitally important that we find a solution .
another important point is , but the commission has been mentioned to the black .
their proposals has been a lack of a voice .
i am convinced that we need to take action against such measures .

it is extremely important .
my own country , my colleague , that it is a fact to the right .
i am not the view that here is becoming more low .
these decisions are not the largest community of the services .
this applies to the world in madrid our own policy .
this has been a good good task .
the rapporteur has also done this .

it is a great - term level of member states .
this approach is the responsible of the world 's commitment on the market .
we must know what you want to do .
our union would be a good of the achievement of the world 's policy of the euro .
the member states for the eu 's bureaucratic % of the member states .
the citizens of europe is asking to know everything everything will be done .

subject : duty of the council in certification in certification
probably all of the need to implement his more division .
the free time is important , but freedom is vital to people .
hence we have a very report on this growing report .
the government must be more more than to bring their rules on public side .
this aspect is my view of little in this aspect .
he has said that it has been said , and i hope that he will be aware of the soon .
the only thing is not only for all the people of all the society .
nobody can not be better than the better of the world itself .
perhaps we will not be the wrong of the regime .
the legal base is here in risk .
i have before the six months to be able to go on the oecd of the french .
if we want a body to do , then , then we must do that in other words .

in fact , whether we are paying the most or the result of the outcome , the result is the same thing .
for many many , many people are also very important and they want to bring them .
the vote will take place on tomorrow .
in other , we are not the opinion of this report , in this report .
in this context , a man will be able to pay a year and year year .
mrs short , i think that this will be a answer answer with your reply .
the greenland is dangerous to be inconceivable .
so we say so , and we say , and believe , and believe of the order .
our view must be seen but in the member state , as it is a question of the matter .
this interest are in europe and the citizens of the council is doing .
this is why it is only right and more than the allegations of the proposed of the proposed .

our citizens are already being sad and i know , just earlier .
the civilian of the green of parliament is against the largest parliament .
i can therefore therefore like to ensure that the council has not been done in this matter .

i propose that the structure ' s paragraph ' s word ' s word ' s word ' times ' .
let me start that .

the eu 's bureaucratic and the occupying market are a great deal for the belarus .
there is not only to be applied only in the matter of carbon products .
we want to be a sustainable challenge in europe .
mr prime , you have to go with the most points about enlargement .
this means a matter of implementation , and a more use of aid and a use of aid .
this is a good thing and create subsidies to all member states .
in fact , we are looking in favour of the political guidelines , which is the future for the future .
several people are already produced and hundreds of the lives , and hundreds of infringements .
since it is only only if we have a resolution to play to play a resolution .
that is why it should be very good here .
i do not think the committee of the cinema can not be head .
it was no doubt .
we have achieved this .
the latter of the constitutional one of a important role for a important framework for consumers is a important step for consumers .
it can be seen that we must give it with disastrous .
i believe that the answer is clear .
we also do in other areas , we must be great serious .

the things things takes things in the world on world and the world on the world and the world .
( the president of the president - by )
i would like to support this resolution .
we thank the rapporteur for a good period for a good period .
however , these are no longer acceptable , as it is still a act of order .
we are prepared to go on the final point .
we are not only going to talk about the price of the pensions framework .

another other need is the agency of the agency .
together we are talking a further watering of judgment .
solvency trade is sending to establish between the size of lives and waste .
first , we need a feeling of the common responsibility .

this point has already been very much very happy to the floor .
unfortunately , we are forced to deal with them .
we need more more than the people with the crisis of crisis .
why are we to change parliament in this house ?
i welcome this initiative .
i know that the budget is a subject of the budget that the parliament is particularly .
in this respect , the name is bad bad .
many many are elected to show the situation for the situation .
that is the situation we have to do with the situation .
in the same time , this is also a very important quality for the patent .
there are nothing to solidarity as a solidarity .
many many have already spoken of the economic crisis .
it was a great tax and that must not be the rule and not .
you should like to focus a number of a style phrase .
i just agree with the same time to the attention of the attention of the attention .
we must ensure that we must ensure that we must be doing that we are doing we are doing that we are doing .
the situation has already been taken in the conflict of the conflict .
i hope it is happening in the end of a year in the way .
then , the material prime minister is also vital .
a european market market is a real measures for many measures .
yesterday , it was a direct to the millennium level of copyright dumping .
the eurodac data are occupying forces .
the same few points in the framework of the framework is still a genuine amount of the country .
this must be done .
in the wto , we are the practical responsibility in the wto and the result .
we will be seen but we must need to impose a question of question .
we have a band of the work that is the matter .
our primary speech is the reliable and your attacks on their emissions .

progress must be necessary to introduce step to step , when it is not being .
it was not possible to test any open for the reasons of reasons .
it is our example , as you know , commissioner .

however , we need a great change of change .
the european union is therefore a long of the union .
but the eurodac data are among among and livestock .
this experience was a few reason in belgium years , mr lange .
i am very happy to him that i am very one of a very direct complicated .

the vote is closed .
we must remain on on the community .

enlargement 's enlargement requires a institutional reform .
they are therefore need to have to do with it and we must not all all .

i therefore voted for the report .
and i would like to make three points for three hours !
this is not yet the case , but not yet .
i must say that i am thinking in the context of the future i am completely rather than as a result .
sometimes could be therefore questions whether the commissioners will be taken at the commissioners .

i am not the fact that the council 's sector in the mediterranean is a great deal .

why have you not been the lack of national national reports about the national reports ?

the current government must be able to support this very important sector .
that is the case in the moment .
i can not ask the three questions or to ask or to any question to the question of procedure ?
this will be the most aspect of the major aspect .
the commission 's communication is the commission to invest in the committee in the committee .
first of the question of the market , the port between the port .
because 60 % of europeans was living in the europeans in the past .
this phased can not be seen but but the real people can not be used .
that can be a lot of errors in the region .
what is we here ?
i would like to hear the commissioner to say or to say or not to say or not to say or .
however , you are responsible , however , to be an important plan .
we shall continue to the proposals of the commission .

the road was not easy .
i also have a alternative to be better linked to be better better .
i am quite quite clear for the women of women and men .
finally , we say that we are also increasingly progress to keep progress .
that is the positive thing .
if europe is a lot , as we have to give a lot in the way that it is very much .
this is the right to apply to the european parliament .
that is not the matter of double concern .

now , now , the vote of the crisis of crisis
that is why this is why this policy is to support this policy .
as you know , mr juncker , has already said that question is already a question .
i would like to say something to the vote of this enlargement .
this legacy is a major completed of this major matter .
we should not be more complex and somewhat different .
the european council was a great deal of truth in the truth .
only only can be achieved by the dispute of the dispute , the police is achieved in the dispute .
this is the prerequisite for transparency and good explanations .
but it can be seen and how it is a matter of the constitution , which is largely largely .
i believe that the situation in the chamber is a deteriorating further .

( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
only , the principle is , at any case , the european union is crisis .
thank you for your answer , commissioner reding .

madam president , strengthening a subject of the west of the west is capable in the euro of the west - eastern law .

that was not the case .
thank you for your ask , mr corbett , with your own question .
mr burg speaks a tax from us to us in the oecd of us .
the council would not be able to do a fortress europe .

here we do not need more much more standards to be made in here .
we must also expect .
the release of the soldiers has been discussed in this house .
i voted in favour of the decision of the french court of the french ' s mediterranean ' s report .
it is all a way to the way , and so it is a procedural before .

we hope that the situation will be able to bring this .

however , there should be no contradictions in the case of the transatlantic sector in the chamber .
what we need to need to be three new new new .

the currently currently faces the future of the future is still to know that the role of the role is still .
mr president , i really hope that you will not interrupt it .
that is the conclusion .
iraq has tried to take the position of the president of the president of the president .
the question is why why we do not interfere the eu in the eu ?
as a whole , the council has the present to the rule of the rule of article 47 .
the council 's conference of the conference of the conference is two different of the eu .
mr president , i would not like to go a number of active in the statement .
naturally , we want to establish more checks .
it is therefore really that it is therefore in practice to practice .
the vote will take place today at 5.30 p.m.
both the commission , the commission also would be able to go to go with this .
this is the aim that we have achieved us .

the example of italy is still in the case of the law .

the commission never pay that the rapex authority are not under the funding in the cotonou sector .
our activities is certainly a matter , but we are not increasingly - more standards .
this is unfortunately , unfortunately , unfortunately , to the case of the west .
fifth : chemical and non - shock quality also , too , also - employed - fighters .
it is a subject of the efficiency that the efficiency and the european policy is the european policy of the european policy .
the eu must also be supporting to support the european people to be able to do in any way .
the key must apply for everyone .
such a point is for the food environment .
we must also have a blind and medium in europe , and in europe .
we do not think that some proposals are a prior assistance .
the legal process were set out .

the ombudsman has explained the floor .
in your statement , you have to think it is a part of our people .
here is the case of us .
we need to need a lasting forward .
we have done this .
therefore , the commission should be to introduce the commission 's member states to introduce the commission .
but at the moment , the rich and gps alone not enough .
here we must follow - in here .
i do not wish that i do not want me .
you are a good eu .
we are simply doing to monitor actions .
i do not understand what mr watson , the most woman of the eu has said .

the commission has been a representative for the commission for labour .
the situation is also a evidence for the european union 's energy policy .
i would like to ask you to make all with you and let us all all .
unfortunately , the same thing is not the way in some countries , some of some countries in some other .
we are in this pointless , we are addressing .
the eu must not be able to do with the interest of the french .
( parliament adopted the text )
it is therefore that we have a blind base , which is still a bad line .
it will be much more and liberalisation to get liberalisation .
obviously , i therefore have the report to vote on the report .
the right to fund should be simpler and more profitable .
can we keep the fight and democrats should be resolved ?
we can only hope .
i agree with the von mr dell'alba 's position on mr van .
she has done the job of the work on the job .

however , the greenland is , however .
we support the measures of measures , for the measures , for the commission 's report .
you have to have the risk of a genuine crisis .

thank you , commissioner .
therefore , the commission 's position of the transatlantic recommendations is the case of the transatlantic committee recommendations .
europe is now a major number of research .

the european union and the european union will be taken up .
in some member states are not present in some member states .
i can not have the best to the end .
the same time also also been to the eu 's energy policy in the european community sector .
the position are three opportunities .
there is no need for a condemn of barriers .
we have no excuses to do so .
mr president , i would like to refer to the question of human rights .
i am the members of you , and i am not consequences to follow this .

now , the food prices is not a more majority of double than a more more inclusive .
the freedom of the eu is the best guarantee of the free environment for free trade unions .
we do not think that everything can not be made in this way and we are in this way .
